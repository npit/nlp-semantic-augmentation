  # embedding aggregation method to document-level representations
  # - avg: average word embeddings to a single doc vector
  # - pad,NUM,filter: force NUM words / embeddings per document, padding / pruning where necessary
  # embedding: train,50,10
  # NUM words are selected by filter:
  # first: just get the first NUM words
  # freq: get the NUM words that are most frequent in the dataset
  aggregation: [pad, 10, first]
