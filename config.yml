# embeddings
embedding: glove,50
# embedding aggregation method to document-level representations
# - avg: average word embeddings to a single doc vector
# - pad,NUM,filter: force NUM words / embeddings per document, padding / pruning where necessary 
# NUM words are selected by filter:
# first: just get the first NUM words
# freq: get the NUM words that are most frequent in the dataset
# aggregation: pad,10,first
aggregation: avg
