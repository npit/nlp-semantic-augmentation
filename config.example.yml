  # aggregation method:
  # - avg: average word embeddings to a single doc vector
  # - [pad,NUM,filter]: e.g. [pad, 10, first]
  # -- pad / num: Pad (or prune) to NUM items: pad, <int>
  # -- filter: how to select these NUM items:
  # --- first: just get the first NUM words
  # --- freq: get the first NUM words that are most frequent in the dataset
  #aggregation: [pad, 10, first]
  aggregation: avg
  # what to do with words missing from the embedding: drop / unk
  # unk: map to an <unknown> category
  # drop: discard them

semantic:
  # which semantic resource will be used. Values: wordnet, context

  unit: concept
  # the form of semantic information to use. Values: frequencies / tfidf
  weights: tfidf
  # optional limit to enforce on semantic information. <num, filter>
  # filter: how to enforce the limit.
  # - first: keep the <limit> first concepts, with the highest weight
  # - frequency-threshold: keep only concepts that appear at least <num> times in the dataset

  # how the semantic information is combined with the textual one. Values: concat, replace
